# Manim-scripts
A repo with all the manim scipts I've made, note VS Code uses a [special workspace](#workspace) because imports don't work otherwise


- HeartBox Explanation: A video explaining how the size of a piece of paper affects the final ["HeartBox"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVYDSMNwlO0&t=304s)
- Shapes: A test file to draw shapes quickly without having to worry about the rest of the video
